# Broccoli & Rice au Gervaise

## Ingredients
### Vegetables
- 2 crowns of broccoli, finely chopped (about 3 cups)
- 1 onion, diced
- 2 cloves garlic, diced
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce
- 1 tsp lemon pepper
- 1/2 tsp red chili flakes

### Rice
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 3 cups water + 1 1/2 tbsp vegetable base (or 1 1/2 cups water and 1 1/2 cups vegetable broth)
- 1 cup brown rice
- 1/2 cup black wild rice

### Garry Sauce
- 1/2 cup soy milk
- 1/2 cup Vegenaise or other mayonnaise
- 1/2 cup nutritional yeast
- 2 tbsp tahini
- 2 tbsp red miso
- 1 tbsp lemon juice
- 1 tsp Dijon mustard
- 1/2 tsp turmeric
- 1/4 tsp garlic powder
- 1/4 tsp onion powder

## Preparation
1: Heat oil for rice over high heat.  Add in rice once oil is hot and coat rice with oil then pour in the broth.  Cover.  Allow broth to boil, then place on low or medium-low heat for 45 minutes

2:  Prepare the vegetables.  When chopping the broccoli only use the florets, discard any thick stems.  Add oil to a hot pan on high heat, then throw in the vegetables, the Worcestershire sauce, and the lemon pepper.  Saute for 6 minutes and set aside.

3:  Combine all the ingredients for the garry sauce in a blender and process until smooth and consistent.

4:  When ten minutes are remaining check rice, drop in the vegetables. Cover.

5:  Once rice and vegetables have finished cooking, fluff rice and stir in garry sauce.  Let sit for fifteen minutes to allow the flavors to meld.

6:  Serve.

## Notes
This version of garry sauce emulates a sharp cheddar-like flavor.  For a less sharp version of the sauce, half the miso, lemon juice, and mustard and add 1/4 cup soaked cashews.

If more depth is desired, add in a cup of finely chopped mushrooms or carrots.
