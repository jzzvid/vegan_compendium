# BBQ Tofu Cutlets

## Ingredients

### Cutlets
- 1 12 oz block extra firm tofu, pressed
- 1 cup BBQ sauce of choice
- light olive oil

### Spice Rub
- 3 tbsp corn meal
- 1 tbsp lemon pepper
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- 1 tsp onion powder
- 2 tsp tarragon
- 1/4 tsp sage
- 1/4 tsp thyme

## Preparation
1:  Cut the block of tofu into sixths, cutting it in half down the long side then creating three thin slices.  Press the tofu for 30 minutes to an hour.

2:  While tofu is being pressed make the spice rub by combining all the ingredients and mixing them thoroughly.

3:  Once the water has been pressed from the tofu coat the tofu in olive oil, then toss in spice mix.  Toss each piece in spice mix again just to ensure each has a thick, even coat.

4:  Heat a frying pan in medium heat with just enough oil to coat the pan and then some, about 3 - 4 tablespoons for a medium pan.  Fry two by two on each side for about 2 - 3 minutes, checking to make sure they do not burn and replenishing the oil as needed.  Set each piece aside and clear the pan.

5:  Place about 1/3 a cup of BBQ sauce in a bowl and dredge a couple cutlets in the sauce and toss into the pan.  Flip cutlets after about two minutes.  Give the cutlets a second dredging and do the same again.

6: Serve with side of BBQ sauce or on a bun for a great sandwich!



## Notes
These cutlets can be prepared on a grill or griddle for a nice charred effects or prepared in the oven instead of fried.

If using the oven set to 425 Â°F.  Bake tofu for 16 minute sessions flipping halfway through.  To get a nice caramelized character out of the tofu, use the broiler for a few minutes.  Take care not to dry out the tofu too much if baking as it will leave it rubbery.
