# Chili Lime Plantains

## Ingredients
- 4 plantains
- 1/4 cup lime juice
- 1 tbsp maple syrup (or molasses)
- 1 chipotle chili in adobo sauce, chopped (optional)
- 1 tbsp adobo sauce (optional)
- 1 tbsp chili powder
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tbsp corn starch
- 2 tbsp wheat flour
- 1 tbsp wheat germ
- canola oil for frying

## Preparation
1:  In a small pot or frying pan begin heating oil over medium-high heat.

2:  Peel and cut the plantains into thick rounds, set aside.

3:  For the batter add the wet ingredients into a small bowl: lime juice, syrup, chipotle, adobo sauce, chili powder, and salt.  Mix well.

4:  For the dry mix, in a separate bowl combine the cornstarch, wheat flour, wheat germ and mix.  Combine the wet batter into the dry until thoroughly incorporated.  Toss in the plantains and coat well.

5:  Fry the plantains in batches.  If using a large pan, no more than 8 or so rounds at a time to ensure they get that nice, crispy golden brown coating.  If not deep frying, turn each round about 2 minutes through frying.

6:  Once done frying transfer to a bowl lined with paper towels and let cool.

7: Serve.
