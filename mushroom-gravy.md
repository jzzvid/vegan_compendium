# Mushroom Gravy

## Ingredients
- 3 tbsp. olive oil or vegan butter
- 1 small onion, chopped
- 1 chopped shallot
- 1 clove garlic
- 1 tsp. thyme
- 1/4 tsp. sage (optional)
- 1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper (optional)
- 6 oz. oyster mushrooms, sliced thin or diced
- 6 oz. shiitake mushrooms, sliced thin or diced
- 1/4 cup dry sherry
- 1 tbsp. Worcestershire sauce
- 1 tbsp. brown sauce
- 1 tbsp. powdered mushrooms
- 2 tbsp. nutritional yeast
- 4 cups broth
- 1 1/2 tbsp. flour
- 3 tbsp cold water
- 1/4 tsp black pepper, ground

## Preparation
1: Heat oil in sauce pan on medium-high heat.  Add in onion, shallot, and garlic.  Saute about 2 minutes.

2: Add in thyme, sage, cayenne pepper. Stir before adding mushrooms and continue to saute for 10 minutes or until mushrooms are browned.

3: Combine sherry, Worcestershire sauce, and brown sauce.  Add to pot and cook until liquid evaporates down to a quarter reduction.

4: Combine broth with powdered mushrooms and nutritional yeast.  Add to pot, bring to boil, and cook down to a half reduction, about 15 minutes.

5: Combine water and flour until smooth.  Add to pot slowly stirring it into the gravy.  Add pepper.  Reduce heat to low and simmer until desired thickness or about 2 - 3 minutes.

6: (optional) Pour gravy into a blender for a smoother gravy if desired.

7: Serve.

## Notes
While this particular recipe is very extravagant, incorporating a lot of flavors and ingredients it is very flexible and can be trimmed down into simple base components for creating other gravies and sauces.  The resulting gravy will be a thick, hearty, with a chunky texture.  A smooth, but thick gravy can be accomplished by blending the gravy.


Powdered mushrooms are easy to make and add a great umami flavor.  Basically these are nothing more than dried shiitake, flower, or other mushroom of choice milled into a fine powder.  You can find these dried mushrooms most Asian food stores and blend them yourself to make the powder.
