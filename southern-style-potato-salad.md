## Notes
Southern Style potato dressing is creamy, with a sharp mustard tang and notes of dill, lemon, and paprika.  It is a flexible dish, and every household in the South has a different variation.  This vegan version is punchy and pronounced.

Lemon juice helps brighten this dish, but some may find in combination with the mustard is unnecessarily sharp.

Black salt adds an eggy flavor to the dish, omit if you do not like eggs in your potato salad.  You may also wish to half the amount for a less pungent flavor.
